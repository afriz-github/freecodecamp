            Ir. Soekarno, commonly known as Bung Karno, was the first president of Indonesia, serving from 1945 to 1967. He played a crucial role in the country's struggle for independence from Dutch colonial rule, famously proclaiming Indonesia's independence on August 17, 1945, alongside Mohammad Hatta. As a prominent nationalist leader, Sukarno was instrumental in uniting the diverse archipelago into a single nation and introduced Pancasila as the foundation of the Indonesian state. His leadership was marked by efforts to promote anti-imperialism and establish Indonesia as a key player in the Non-Aligned Movement. Despite facing significant political challenges and ultimately losing power in a military coup in 1965, Sukarno is remembered as a national hero and the "Father of Proclamation."
